Thanks for contributing to **Small Games Python**!

This repository is a collection of **small Python games and remakes**, so please keep contributions simple and follow the guidelines below.

## Contributing a Game
Games must follow the definition of **small** used in this repository:

* A game may require **no more than 5 files, including the main file**
* Extra files should only exist when necessary (for example: word lists or small data files)
* Only the **main file** will be put into the repository.

Try to keep the code **simple, readable, and self-contained**.

### Interfaces
Games are organized by **interface**.
Place your game in the correct directory.

Examples include:
* `cli` – terminal / command-line games
* `pygame` – games using pygame
* `arcade` – games using the arcade library

If your game uses a new interface that doesn't exist yet, or isn't listed in the repository, you may create an issue for it.

### Naming
* Use **lowercase filenames**, words separated by underscores if needed.
* Prefer **descriptive names**

Example:
```
cli/hangman.py
pygame/snake.py
pygame/lights_out.py
```

### Dependencies
Try to **avoid unnecessary dependencies**.

If your game requires an external library (such as pygame), it should:
* **Be clear from the folder it is placed in**
* **Be common and easy to install**
* **Be listed in a comment if needed**

### Code Style
There are **no strict formatting requirements**, but please try to:

* Write readable code
* Add comments when useful
* Avoid extremely large or complex programs

**Remember: these are meant to be small games.**

### Duplicate Games

Before contributing a game, please check whether a similar game already exists in the repository.

Duplicate implementations of the same game are generally discouraged unless they are meaningfully different. Examples of acceptable differences include:

* A different **interface** (e.g. `cli/snake.py` vs `pygame/snake.py`)
* A significantly different **gameplay style or mechanics**
* A **clearly improved or expanded** version

If your version is only a small variation of an existing game, consider **improving the existing file instead**.

## Modifying an Existing File

Modifications to existing games are allowed, but should generally be limited to:

* **Bug fixes**
* **Small improvements** (performance, readability, minor features)
* **Compatibility fixes** (library updates, Python version issues)
* **Documentation or comment improvements**

Please **avoid completely rewriting or heavily restructuring someone else's game** unless it is necessary to fix a problem. If a large change is needed, it is recommended to **open an issue first** to discuss it.

All changes should keep the game **small and simple**, following the same requirements listed above.

## Submitting
1. Fork the repository
2. Add your game in the **correct interface folder**
3. Open a pull request with a **short description of the game**, preferably including:
   * a basic summary
   * controls
   * and whether it's original or not
